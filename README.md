# Module-3-Challenge

## Description

Javascript Password Generator, or Module 3's Challenge, is to randomly generate a new, secure password for employees that have access to sensitive data. The task will be achieved when an employee can click a button, answer subsequent prompts, and be provided a password that fits the prompt criteria. For greater security, the password must be within 8 and 128 characters and include at least one of the following criteria: uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character. If the prompts are incorrectly entered, the password will not be generated and will ask the user to try again. This challenge will test our ability to understand Javascript and utilize functions, arrays, variables, if/else functions and references.
